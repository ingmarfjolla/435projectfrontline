Since this was a project used for learning MySQL, I leveraged pythons MySQL driver to directly add to my database once data was collected. Beforehand however, I used beautiful soup and selenium to automate the process of extracting data from different news sources that were reporting on the deaths of each of the workers. The data was then formatted and normalized to insert into my database. 
Then using Node JS and Javascript I was able to display them for my application.
